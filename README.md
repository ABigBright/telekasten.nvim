# telekasten.nvim

A Neovim (lua) plugin for working with a markdown zettelkasten, based on telescope.nvim

## Install and setup

**MS Windows note:** At the moment, telekasten is unlikely to be able to run on Windows, because it relies on a bash script.  Just sayin.  Since telekasten is a project that scratches my own itch, I am not sure if I will add Windows support any time soon.  Should anyone read this: Pull requests are welcome ðŸ˜„!  Replacing the daily finder by a proper lua version should do the trick.

### 1. Install the plugin
Install with your plugin manager of choice.  Mine is [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

```vimscript
Plugin 'renerocksai/telekasten'
```

### 2. Configure telekasten
Somewhere in your vim config, put a snippet like this:

```vimscript
lua << END
require('telekasten').setup({
     home         = vim.fn.expand("~/zettelkasten"),
     dailies      = vim.fn.expand("~/zettelkasten/daily"),
     extension    = ".md",
     daily_finder = "daily_finder.sh",
     
     -- where to install the daily_finder, 
     -- (must be a dir in your PATH)
     my_bin       = vim.fn.expand('~/bin'),   

     -- download tool for daily_finder installation: curl or wget
     downloader = 'curl',
     -- downloader = 'wget',  -- wget is supported, too
})
END
```

### 3. Install the daily finder
Before using telekasten, a shell script needs to be installed.  It finds and sorts notes the way we want.  As long as I don't have a lua version for this functionality (this is literally the first time I use lua), we will have to stick with `daily_finder.sh`.

Luckily, the plugin can install the daily finder for you, directly from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renerocksai/telekasten/main/ext_commands/daily_finder.sh):

```
:lua require('telekasten').install_daily_finder()
```

This will download the daily finder into the `bin/` folder of your home directory - or the directory you specified as `my_bin` in the step above.

## Use it

The plugin defines the following functions.

- `find_notes()` : find notes by file name (title), via Telescope
- `find_daily_notes()` : find daily notes by date (file names, sorted, most recent first), via Telescope
- `search_notes()`: live grep for word under cursor in all notes (search in notes), via Telescope
- `insert_link()` : select a note by name, via Telescope, and place a `[[link]]` at the current cursor position
- `follow_link()`: take word under cursor and open a Telescope file finder with it: selects note to open (incl. preview)
- `install_daily_finder()` : installs the daily finder tool used by the plugin
- `setup(opts)`: used for configuring paths, file extension, etc.

To use one of the functions above, just run them with the `:lua ...` command.  

```vimscript
:lua require("telekasten").find_daily_notes()
```

## Bind it 
Usually, you would set up some key bindings, though:

```vimscript
nnoremap <leader>zf :lua require('telekasten').find_notes()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>zd :lua require('telekasten').find_daily_notes()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>zg :lua require('telekasten').search_notes()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>zz :lua require('telekasten').follow_link()<CR>

" note: we define [[ in **insert mode** to call insert link
inoremap [[ <ESC>:lua require('telekasten').insert_link()<CR>
```
