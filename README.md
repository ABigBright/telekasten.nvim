This repository is a temporary fork of the great [Telekasten](https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim) plugin for Nvim.

We have introduced bug fixes that allow the Telekasten plugin usage not only on Unix-like machines (e.g. Linux and macOS) but also on Windows.

Important: This repository is likely to be removed once the original project fixes the bugs that prevent cross-platform usage of the plugin.
